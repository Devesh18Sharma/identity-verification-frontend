# Identity Verification Frontend

A frontend application for identity verification.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed Node.js (which includes npm). You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd identity-verification-frontend
   ```
3. Install NPM packages:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port shown in your terminal) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run lint`

Lints the project files using ESLint to check for code quality and potential errors.

### `npm run preview`

Serves the production build from the `dist` folder locally. This is a good way to check if the production build works correctly before deploying.
